# Setup

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repo
3. Follow the Database instructions below
2. Navigate to the directory and run `npm install` 
4. Fix to binaries for sass run `npm rebuild node-sass`
4. Run the server `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
6. Register and Login to access full functionality

### Database

1. Open `psql` and type `CREATE DATABASE midterm;`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change

- DB_HOST= your hostname eg localhost
- DB_USER= your username
- DB_PASS= your password

- SENDGRID_API_KEY= create SendGrid account and enter API key

3. Navigate to the directory and run `npm run db:reset` to seed database


## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Dependencies

- Node 10.x or above
